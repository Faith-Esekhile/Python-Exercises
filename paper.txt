much easier to scale
applications and

institutions have
access to

support and secure

traditional hardware

cloud computing education:
Cloud computing enables students, teachers, and staff to create
and deliver content from anywhere, anytime, on any device. It frees up IT
administrators and lowers hardware and software licensing costs. During the
pandemic, cloud technology has made it easier for administrators, faculty, and
students to work from home yet collaborate effectively.
There is a potentially massive return on investment in cloud operations that was
not possible with on-premises applications, infrastructure, and services. The
cloud makes it much easier to scale applications and share resources.
Institutions have access to infrastructure support and secure backups. Funds
formerly spent on traditional hardware and software systems can be re-allocated
to improve student outcomes.
